Overview/description of the project: For this second project, I am tasked with creating a working Giphy search engine, using an API key to populate GIFs. In accordance with project guidelines, I used flex to ensure my site's name and navigation bar appear aligned to the sides of the header, and input field. The submit button appears side by side with the other items in the navigation bar.   

Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: To use the Giphy Search website, users can either start by clicking on pages in the navigation bar to visit the About and Contact pages, or they can click on the search bar and select 'search' to populate images and GIFs. The contact form leads to an external source, Formspree, to collect and store responses.

Technologies Used ( .HTML , .CSS, .JS ): A combination of HTML, JavaScript and CSS were used to create this GIF search website. To make the site more realistic, the navigation bar also includes An About page and a Contact page, which recieves responses through Formspree and sends them to my personal email adress (syanok@yahoo.com). 

Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3):
Adding additional images, other than the search results, to make the Contact and About pages more appealing.
Using the Promise variable for more text in the website, so it appears at different times.
Add more spacing between the blocks of text to spread them out more on the webpages.
